  <h1>HTTP and APIs Challenge</h1>
  <p>Each Thursday, we&#39;ll take a break from coding to practice interview questions with our partner. These questions will (primarily) revolve around the content we learned this week, and, much like a &quot;real&quot; interview, some will be more technical than others. </p>
  <p>In addition to learning how to implement the new tools, technologies, and concepts, you want to become comfortable <em>talking</em> about them too, so you may accurately <em>demonstrate</em> and <em>communicate</em> these skills you&#39;ve learned to potential employers in an interview. </p>
  <p>Take turns answering the questions below with your partner: </p>
  <h2>Technical Interview Questions</h2>
  <p><hr></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe an HTTP GET request.</li>
    <li>Describe an HTTP POSt request.</li>
    <li>Describe the differences between an HTTP POST request, and a GET request. When would you use one over the other?</li>
    <li>When we say an HTTP request includes headers, what are we referring to? What information is included in a header? Why?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between a 500 HTTP response and a 400 HTTP response? What about a 200 response? </li>
    <li>When we use the term &quot;payload&quot; in terms of interacting with APIs and making HTTP requests, what are we talking about? What does a payload contain?</li>
    <li>What information might be sent in a query string?</li>
    <li>What are your favorite API resources for Ruby and Rails? What APIs have you worked with? How did it go? </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Stories and Examples</h3>
  <p>Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes <em>much further</em> in an interview than simply <em>telling</em> your interviewer you&#39;re good at something. (ie: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying <em>&quot;I&#39;m good at problem-solving!&quot;</em>). </p>
  <p>Have you heard of the <strong>SHARE</strong> technique? It&#39;s a useful guideline for telling stories and giving examples that demonstrate your capabilities in an interview. It works like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S</strong>: Describe a <em>situation</em> you faced relevant to the interviewer&#39;s question.</li>
    <li><strong>H</strong>: Outline the <em>hinderances</em> and challenges the situation presented.</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong>: Describe the <em>action(s)</em> you took in response.</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong>: Go over the <em>results</em> of your actions.</li>
    <li><strong>E</strong>: Then, <em>evaluate</em> what you&#39;ve learned. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using the SHARE outline, give an example of a time....</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You faced issues working with a partner or team. What did you do to resolve it? How did it work out?</li>
    <li>You became incredibly frustrated with your code. What was the issue? What did you do? Would you have done anything differently?</li>
    <li>You refactored really well. How did you do it? Why? What led you to refactor? </li>
    <li>You utilized an outside resource to solve a problem. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you come up with a story or example you feel good about; jot it down somewhere! Seriously! It&#39;s tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later. </p>
